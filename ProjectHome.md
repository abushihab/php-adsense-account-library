PHP AdSense account library is a PHP class that can retrieve a variety of reports from AdSense account (like impressions, clicks, ctr, etc.) It's based on [PHP AdSense account monitor](http://www.webtoolkit.info/php-adsense-account-monitor.html) class.

**This library is now deprecated** since Google released AdSense management API: http://code.google.com/apis/adsense/management/index.html.
